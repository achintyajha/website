It might just be me, but I've always had this problem of having no place to throw links, random ideas, and reminders. This usually happens when I'm away from my machine, say on my phone. Sending emails to myself did work for quite a bit, but again, I'd always prefer an easier workaround or something made specifically for this purpose.

There are a billion note-taking software already, but I decided to build my own personalised tool for this very purpose. Something that's lightweight, requires no install, and is accessible on all devices. Building a web-app was the way forward, and I decided to use my other project, [dynote](https://github.com.achintyajha/dynote), as a starting point.

The final product is just how I want it to be- a minimal note taking space with markdown support and live preview. Posting the note is nearly instantaneous and just with one click, I can see it from anywhere around the world, without ever logging in. Most of these notes, in my case, are just links of nice web designs or blog posts I plan on reading later. Being able to view something as simple as that, hassle-free, accomplishes the goal for me.

Here's how it all comes out at the end-
