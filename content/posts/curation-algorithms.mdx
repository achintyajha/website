Curation Algorithms, at first, may sound like some recent, revolutionary technology, but it’s something that’s been around for decades. As the name itself suggests, these are algorithms that curate; they organize and personalize content using algorithms (a set of rules).

So, how often do you encounter a curation algorithm in play? Almost all the time. From your daily news briefing to your Amazon recommendations, or even your Spotify daily mix, all these come from the curation algorithms at work. Nearly everything that you may relate to recommendations has some sort of curation algorithm embedded inside. Netflix recommendations, Amazon recommendations ("Customers who bought this also bought"), and of course, those repetitive ads everywhere are some common examples.
Now, how do these even work? It's simple, they store your browsing data, factor in your location, age, a few other inputs, and voila! They have your recommendations ready.

### The Problem

However, there is a significant problem here. Curation algorithms have been ineffective in personalizing content. Many methods similar to curation algorithms involving Artificial Intelligence are widely used in the financial sector, serving as an indispensable commodity. Predicting the ups and downs, of say, the stock market, can to some extent be done using past data. However, predicting which song you might like next is a bit more abstract and complex than that. This is because what you might like has very little to do with a pattern. Humans explore possibilities; they try out a lot of things before concluding. Therefore something as complex as our thoughts, preferences, and choices are challenging to predict using an algorithm.
The problem this creates is the increasing number of generalized recommendations, which are pointless. You may not realise it, but the content you see everywhere is **not so personalised.**
To understand this, we need to take something that we regularly encounter. We all listen to music, read the news, or at least shop online, and again, it's the curation algorithms at work here. If you were to take a song recommendation from a human, say your friend, its more probable that you might like their suggestion. This is because a friend would consider a larger amount of factors, such as your music-taste, singers you like and don't like, and so on. Now here’s an important point: the algorithm may consider which singers you like(based on what you hear), but it most likely has no idea about the music/genre you don't like and may recommend that as well.

### The Data Risk

But why is the failure of algorithms such a big deal, considering that it is getting better every day?
Now, here's the twist: various third-party companies are accessing this same data for generating ads, spam emails, fraudulent calls, and whatnot. What's more intimidating is that most of the time, this happens without our permission. Matters relating to personal data and privacy are susceptible, and any misconduct in this department is unacceptable.
Many-a-times, people don't realize the value of their data. They don't realize that this data is their personal information, which can be used to deceive them and put them at the risk of scammers. Awareness is crucial, but what's more important is that people should be ready to take action. Large companies hold humongous amounts of data, and it is important to ensure that it's safely stored.

### Future Of Curation Algorithms

Therefore, something that we must honestly ask ourselves is that how are curation algorithms helping us? Well, they were meant for personalization, at which they have failed. Moreover, information about us is at the risk of being sold for malpractices—a total lose-lose situation.
However, before you conclude that this is yet another failed invention, remember that it is an emerging technology, and there is scope for a lot of development. In the coming years, curation algorithms will exhibit better performances. Progress can already be seen in many companies, including **Netflix**, where a larger number of factors are considered while curating content for users. As a result, it is one of the most popular OTT (over-the-top) platforms in the world. Netflix had over **200 million subscribers** (as of January 2021), with a growth rate exceeding 22% per annum. Thanks to the intelligent algorithm in play, Netflix has been able to do justice to content makers, producers, and users.

Netflix has recently adapted a curation algorithm for custom artworks (the posters of TV shows and movies). This algorithm as a whole has been able to deliver customised artworks for every user. The poster you see would feature those aspects of the show that you like—for instance, the actors, the genre, and everything. If a show features action and thrill, and you like thrillers, you would be shown a poster portraying that dimension of the film. Super-cool right? And this is just getting better every day. Despite the several shortcomings of curation algorithms, there is a lot that they can offer in the future.

### Conclusion

Curation Algorithms come with problems. However, we must embrace the fact that technology gets better every passing minute, and the next 4-5 years would likely bring about substantial and positive change in this sector. Another key takeaway is that the more the data, the better the algorithm and thus, a much better experience. But with more data, our invaluable information is exposed to multiple risks. Therefore, companies should be ready to undertake this responsibility as well. And most importantly, we, the people, need to be aware.
