A **look** at markdown's beautiful syntax!

> Markdown allows you to add blockquotes like this!

And code snippets like _this_

```python
    if True:
        print("Hello World")
    # comments work too
```

```css
    body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    }
```

Here's a [link](https://www.achintyajha.in)

This is a list-

1. Hello!
2. World!

Unordered list-

- hello!
- world!
