**[SentiMate:](https://sentimate.org)** A Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning based model that is capable of using text for identifying depression.

**[StuClan:](https://talk.sentimate.org)** A web based micro-blogging app primarily designed helping out people solve problems relating to mental health and educational stress.

**[Climate Crew:](https://climate-crew.ml/)** The idea is to spread knowledge and awareness about Climate through storytelling. I have developed this website, where our team has posted self-authored unique stories that provide a historical as well as mythological perspective to Climate.

**[Auto SNAKE:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyFxc-_l1jQ)** A reinforcement learning model that uses Deep Q-Learning to learn to play 'Snake'. The attached link is a video that shows a demonstration of the learning process.
